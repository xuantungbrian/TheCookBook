# project The Cook Book

# Project Summary:
Our project allows users to keep track of their inventory of ingredients by adding and removing from it. They can also search for recipes that fit their search criteria, such as whether they have all ingredients, or high calorie recipes. Users can choose what information they want to see from the recipes, such as difficulty and nutritional value. Users can also search for eateries based on the type of restaurant and cuisine. Additionally, if the user is an admin, they will have the ability to see the inventory count for all users, update information about the eatery branches, delete an eatery (which also deletes all related branches) and perform search queries on any table of their choice.
